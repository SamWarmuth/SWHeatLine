A simple UIView subclass that takes an array of values 0-100 and displays a horizontal linear gradient displaying those values. Useful for mapping values over time in a small space. It's less accurate than a [Sparkline](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparkline), but is more obvious when mapping absolute values (e.g. a student's score in a class over the semester -- A is Green, F is Red).
